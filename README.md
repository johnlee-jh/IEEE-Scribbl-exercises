# Learning Module for Scribbl.ieee

## Overview
These coding assignments are built to teach new members on full-stack technologies such as HTML/CSS/JS, Python, and Git workflow.

Each assignment is designed to take about 1~2 hours.

Week 1: Create a simple personal website to get an 'feel' of HTML/CSS

Week 2: Add JavaScript and responsivity to your personal website

Week 3: Complete a mini-python project using the Feature branch workflow

## Instructions
**Week 1:**

1. Fork this repository (keep it public!)
2. Add HTML/CSS to **index.html**, which serves as your 'home' page. (Do NOT create extra HTML files for now, that will be a week 2 assignment)
3. Host it on Github Pages
4. Finish before the next weekly meeting and commit your changes, so that you can get review comments!

To submit: A link to your Forked Github repo

**Week 2:**

1. Create a new page on HTML, name it *anything*.html
2. Add a navigation bar to your website, and link your new HTML page to the navigation bar
3. Make it responsive for 1280x800 (normal screen) and 420x900 (mobile)
4. Implement at least 2 JavaScript functions for various features
5. Create an *assets* folder and store your CSS/JavaScript files there
6. Finish before the next weekly meeting, so that you can get review comments!

To submit: A link to your website through Github Pages

**Week 3:**

1. Read the project specs outlined in the Readme.md file inside the /python-exercise folder https://github.com/johnlee-jh/IEEE-Scribbl-exercises/blob/master/python-exercise/README.md
2. Brainstorm with your peers on how you will create the simple tic-tac-toe game. What methods will you use? How will you divide up the work? Create a design document before proceeding to divide the work and coding the actual project.
3. Use the Feature Branch workflow to divide the work, and upload a visual representation of your workflow with who worked on each feature. Example at https://github.com/johnlee-jh/IEEE-Scribbl-exercises/blob/master/python-exercise/workflow-example.png
4. Merge your commits together! You shouldn't run into conflicts, but if you do please notify me (John) on Slack, and I'll go over the code with you!
5. Finish before the next weekly meeting, and fill out the front-end/back-end interest form at https://forms.gle/jVyqz2dAFaC4Rern8 !
6. You're done with all the practice exercises! Get hyped to actually start building Scribbl.ieee :)

To submit: Design document, Visual representation of your team's Git workflow, Python game code inside the /python-exercise folder

## Local Testing
**For HTML/CSS/JS:**

In Visual Studio Code, download the Live Server extension. https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer

OR just click on the HTML file and open in your browser (no live edit though).

**For Python:**

Well, it depends on how you create your project üíÅ
